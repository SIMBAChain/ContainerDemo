# container-demo

> A simple demo shows how to use SIMBA API to post and get info to/from a private blockchain(Circle of Life). It supports posting/geting info as three different roles. An Ethereum account is auto generated and Ethers are auto deposited if no wallet is detected on user's browser. It auto signs the transaction when a post being made. 


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# create and configure an app on Simba Dashboard 
# with the `container-demo` smart contract
# at https://app.simbachain.com/

# generate APIKEYs on `App-View` page for SIMBA-API and Configuration(management) API

# open src/components/gateways/simba-api.js, replace `baseURL` and `APIKEY` with yours

# open src/components/gateways/manage-api.js, replace `APIKEY` with yours

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
